NAME
    CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANIDX - CPANIDX source implementation

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      # In the CPANPLUS shell

      CPAN Terminal> s conf no_update 1
      CPAN Terminal> s conf source_engine CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANIDX
      CPAN Terminal> s save

DESCRIPTION
    CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANIDX is a CPANPLUS source
    implementation.

    It is highly experimental.

    Usually CPANPLUS retrieves the CPAN index files, extracts them and
    builds an in-memory index of every module listed on CPAN. As you can
    imagine, this is quite memory intensive.

    This source implementation does things slightly different.

    Instead of building an in-memory index, it queries an App::CPANIDX based
    website for module/distribution/author information as and when it is
    required by CPANPLUS.

    The default CPANIDX site is <http://cpanidx.org/cpanidx/>.

    You may set the "PERL5_CPANIDX_URL" environment variable to an
    alternative if you wish.

CAVEATS
    There are some caveats.

    As shown in the "SYNOPSIS" you must set the CPANPLUS configuration
    variable "no_update" to a true value to use this source engine. This
    prevents CPANPLUS from attempting to update CPAN indexes.

    Attempting to searches and getting a list of out of date modules in
    CPANPLUS are incredibly slow due the million or so web accesses that are
    incurred.

    I have included two scripts in the "examples" directory of this
    distribution that may be of use. "installer.pl" does installation of
    modules and "updater.pl" will find out of date modules and prompt to
    update them.
